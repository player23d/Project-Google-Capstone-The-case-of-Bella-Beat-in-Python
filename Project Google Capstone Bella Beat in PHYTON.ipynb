    "This project serves as a final milestone to attain the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics). It involves the case study on [Bellabeat](https://bellabeat.com), a tech wellness company that manufactures health-focused smart products for women. Bellabeat offer a range of smart devices that collects various health and lifestyle data to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits. The smart devices work hand in hand with the Bellabeat app to provide users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits. Thus, users will be able to better understand their current habits and make healthy decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this study is to analyze consumers' usage data on non-Bellabeat smart devices and determine how it could unlock new growth opportunities for Bellabeat. The insights drawn will be used to develop high level recommendations for Bellabeat's marketing strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the exploratory data analysis (EDA) approach will be used to analyze and investigate for trends, patterns, and relationships to derive insights from the dataset. This will be guided through the process of Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act using the Python programming language.\n",

    "The aim of this project is to draw insights into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices and develop high level recommendations for Bellabeat's marketing strategy with the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are some trends in Fitbit smart device usage?\n",
    "2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n",
    "3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?\n",

    "# <span style=\"color:#DD3E02\"> 3. Prepare Phase </span> <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"prepare_phase_3\"></a> \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1 Dataset used: <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"dataset_used_3_1\"></a> \n",
    "\n",
    "The [Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit) from the Kaggle web repository will be used for this analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2 Accessibility and privacy of data: <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"accessibility_and_privacy_of_data_3_2\"></a> \n",
    "The dataset is confirmed to be open-source and licensed under the CC0: Public Domain. The owner has dedicated the work to the public domain by waiving all of his or her rights to the work worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights, to the extent allowed by law. The dataset can be copied, modified, distributed, and used for analysis, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3 Information about our dataset:<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"information_about_our_dataset_3_3\"></a>  \n",
    "The dataset is generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk over 31 days between 03.12.2016 - 05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.4 Data Organization and verification: <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"data_organization_and_verification_3_4\"></a> \n",
    "The dataset consists of 18 CSV files in total with each containing various health and activity metrics tracked by Fitbit. Using the elimination approach to remove irrelevant dataframes from the analysis, a total of 13 dataframes were eliminated as they are either duplicates of a larger dataframe, too few of a sample size, or contain data that were not meaningful for the analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, here are the 5 dataframes that will be used for this analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Table Name | Type | Description |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| 1. dailyActivity_merged | Microsoft Excel CSV | Daily Activity over 31 days of 33 IDs. Tracking daily: Steps, Distance, Intensities, Calories |\n",
    "| 2. hourlyCalories_merged | Microsoft Excel CSV | Hourly Calories burned over 31 days of 33 IDs |\n",
    "| 3. hourlyIntensities_merged | Microsoft Excel CSV | Hourly total and average intensity over 31 days of 33 IDs |\n",
    "| 4. hourlySteps_merged | Microsoft Excel CSV | Hourly Steps over 31 days of 33 IDs |\n",
    "| 5. sleepDay_merged | Microsoft Excel CSV| Daily sleep logs, tracked by: Total count of sleeps a day, Total minutes, Total Time in Bed of 24 IDs |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.5 Data Integrity and limitations:<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"data_credibility_and_integrity_3_5\"></a> \n",
    "The dataset had the limitation of having too small of a sample size (30 users) that may not represent the entire population and may render conclusions drawn from the analysis to be invalid. Furthermore, demographical information such as age, gender, and ethnicity that is crucial to determine the strategy on Bellabeat's target market were not provided in the dataset.\n",

    "# <span style=\"color:#DD3E02\">  4. Process Phase </span> <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"process_phase_4\"></a> \n",

Nevertheless, according to the [U.S. Department of Health and Human Services](https://health.gov/our-work/nutrition-physical-activity/dietary-guidelines/previous-dietary-guidelines/2015), the average adult women expends roughly 1,600 to 2,400 calories per day, and the average adult man uses 2,000 to 3,000 calories per day. \n",

There is an obvious trend where users begin to increase their calories burned gradually from 5am to mid-day. A slight drop in the amount of calories burned from 1-2pm was also observed. This is likely due to the occurence of postprandial somnolence (A.K.A Food Coma)  or the 'afternoon slump' that usually happens after lunch between 1-3pm leading to fewer calories  burned while being tired. \n",

    "2. \"What is the proportion of westerners using Bellabeat's products?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This will play a crucial role in identifying how the products are accepted in different segments which will ultimately influence how Bellebeat drive its marketing campaigns. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Creating Fun**\n",
    "Bellabeat could provide rewards and virtual achievements to users within the app when they reached certain milestones. As a user of Apple Watch, I personally felt that the virtual rewards feature has encourage me to clock in the extra active minutes to earn various awards within the app and I believe this concept could be applied to the Bellabeat app as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides, Bellabeat could look into using the concept of gamification where users could redeem vouchers from merchant partners or Bellabeat line of products by hitting specific goals and rising through the reward tiers. This injects a 'fun' element in spurring users to take charge of their health and lifestyle habits which could reduce the the amount of sedentary time and increase the daily activity level of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Getting Social**\n",
    "Bellabeat could incoporate a social share feature that allow users to share their daily activity and workouts in the bellabeat app with their family and friends. In addition, they could include a compete feature that enables users to challenge against one another to improve the number of steps taken and calories burned. This way users would not feel 'alone' in their fitness journey and Bellabeat could potentially attract new customers into the Bellabeat ecosystem with the influence of existing users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Friendly Reminder**\n",
    "To prompt users in adopting a more active lifestyle, Bellabeat could allow users to configure the app and device settings that will serve as reminders and motivations to achieve their desired lifestyle goals. This could involve a vibration functionality on the device or push notifications via the app that will remind users to get active or practice a consistent bedtime routine. The push notifications could also include positive reinforcements to users by showing their progress achieved throughout the day or week with the data collected. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples include: \n",
    "1. \"Hey there! Another hour has past, get up and move your muscles!\"\n",
    "2. \"Woah! Keep it going! You took 20% more steps than yesterday at this time!\"\n",
    "3. \"Ring Ring, its almost bedtime. Don't forget to practice a consistent sleep schedule.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Going Zen**\n",
    "Finally, Bellabeat could incorporate breathing or mindfulness functions in the app to help users wind down or relieve their anxiety and stress levels before bed time. This functions could also be interlinked with push notifications that would remind users to practice breathing and mindfulness activites before their scheduled bedtime. Helpful sleep health articles could also be supplemented in the app to provide tips and insights like breathing and relaxation techniques that would improve one's sleep quality. \n",
